## Input Text

# Plan: Complete Kait-to-Kait Rename & QA Review

## Context

The project is being renamed from "Kait Intelligence" to "Kait Intelligence" (package name: `kait-intel`). The rename is ~60% complete: `pyproject.toml` name, repo URL, all `kait_*` root files, `kait/` package, `lib/sidekick/`, tests, and docs exist. However, there are broken imports (`lib.kait_emotions` doesn't exist), 100+ stale `kait` references in kait files, and duplicate kait/kait file pairs that need cleanup.
